# Project Documentation Generation Plan

This rule outlines the process for analyzing the project codebase and generating technical documentation based on user-provided information.

**Goal:** Generate a comprehensive Markdown document describing the project's structure, features, tech stack, and usage based on code analysis.

**Interaction Flow:**

1.  **Receive Directory Structure:** The user will first provide an overview of the project's directory structure (e.g., using `tree` output or a list).
2.  **Request/Receive Key Files:** Based on the structure, I may request specific key files, or the user will proactively provide the content of core files (entry points, logic modules, configurations, etc.).
3.  **Analyze Code:** I will analyze the provided directory structure and file contents.
4.  **Generate Document:** Using the gathered information, I will generate a Markdown document with the following sections:
    *   Project Overview
    *   Project Structure
    *   Main Features
    *   Technology Stack
    *   How to Run/Use (if available)

**Guidance:**

*   Focus on information directly derivable from the provided code and structure.
*   Clearly state any uncertainties or areas requiring more information.
*   Reference specific files or code snippets when describing structure and features.
*   The final output should be a well-formatted Markdown document.
